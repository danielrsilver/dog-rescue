          <p>The philosophy behind our dog rescue hinges on the novel idea that rescue facilities need not be sad places. That was the starting point. Over many years of design, redesign and ongoing construction, we doubled down on that mindset. Today, Dog Rescue is the happiest place on earth for dogs transitioning from homeless to forever homes.</p>
